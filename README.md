**Note (2020/11/24), weblink for automatically retrieving solar wind parameters has been updated. Now CAT-PUMA is able to get the solar wind parameters automatically.**

**Note, from 2019.09, NASA has closed all external access to its FTP servers. Due to this, CAT-PUMA is no longer able to retrieve solar wind parameters automatically. Instead, you could manually type in the parameters.**
